            <h1>PLA Rocket v1</h1>
            <p>
                In 2022, the rocket project began with the development of the first prototype. 
                The design featured a PVC pipe as the casing and a 3D-printed PLA nozzle. 
                A convergent nozzle design was chosen for its simplicity, aiming to create a functional prototype using readily available and affordable materials due to budget constraints.
                To delay the fusion of the PLA nozzle during combustion, several alternatives were explored. 
                The most effective solution involved applying a thin layer of plaster at the nozzle throat. 
                However, the extreme output velocity eventually sheared off the plaster layer during operation.

            The video below demonstrates a test in which the thrust force was measured using a scale. 
            Midway through the experiment, the chamber pressure caused the nozzle to detach, as bolts were not used in this prototype to secure the nozzle to the casing.

            <h1>Aluminum Rocket v2</h1>
            <p>
                As the PLA nozzle was unable to withstand the intense heat generated during combustion, an upgraded metallic version was developed. 
                Aluminum was chosen as the material due to its significantly lower density compared to steel, while still offering excellent mechanical properties and heat dissipation.
                To aid in the design process, a Python-based analytical calculator was created. 
                This tool estimates the rocket's thrust by taking inputs such as throat diameter, combustion chamber dimensions, and the propellant mixture. 
                The dimensions were carefully selected to balance optimal performance with ease of manufacturability.
                Using these calculated dimensions, the nozzle was modeled in CAD software. 
                Both the nozzle and the top enclosure were sent to a specialized company for 3D printing in aluminum. 
                The upgraded design incorporated several enhancements, including bolted connections for improved stability, sealing O-rings to prevent leaks, 
                and a cork laminate to insulate the aluminum casing from the extreme heat of combustion.
