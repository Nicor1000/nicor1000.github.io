            <h1>PLA Rocket v1</h1>
            <p>
                In 2022 the rocket project started. The first rocket prototype was fabricated using a PVC pipe as casing and a 3D printed PLA nozzle. 
                In this first model a convergent nozzle was utilized for its simplicity. The objetive was to make an initial working version with simple materials as the budget was very limited.

            <h1>Aluminum Rocket v2</h1>
            <p>
                As the PLA nozzle was not able to withstand the heat from the combustion an upgraded metallic version was studied. 
                The selected material was aluminium as it presents a significantly lower density while presenting great heat dissipation capabilities. 
                Manufacturing a rocket model from Aluminium requires of more complex machinery. So, the parts were 3D printed by a third party manufacturer and then assembled together.
